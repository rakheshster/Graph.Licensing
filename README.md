# Graph Licensing
Source code a module I created for managing Entra ID licensing via Graph. It isn't complete in any way. 

You can install the module [from PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Graph.Licensing/).

## This module needs the following to be already present
- "Microsoft.Graph.Authentication"
- "Microsoft.Graph.Groups"
- "Microsoft.Graph.Users"
- "Microsoft.Graph.Identity.DirectoryManagement"
- "Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleGuiTools"
